# MessagePack for Lua 5.3 / 5.4

## Overview

This is a pure Lua implementation for encoding/decoding MessagePack (https://msgpack.org).

Please report any bugs you encounter!

Features:
- written in pure Lua 5.3 / 5.4 (using ```string.pack()``` / ```string.unpack()```)
- can distinguish between integer / float / double numbers
- can distinguish between UTF-8 strings and binary data
- public domain license (http://unlicense.org)
- pretty fast decoding

What's missing:
- extendend types ```fixent```

Example code:
```lua
local msgpack = require('msgpack')

local value = msgpack.decode(binary_msgpack_data) -- decode to Lua value

local binary_data = msgpack.encode(lua_value) -- encode Lua value to MessagePack
```

## API

### msgpack.encode_one(value)
Encodes the given Lua value to a binary MessagePack representation. It will return the binary string on succes or ```nil``` plus an error message if it fails.

The encoder will encode Lua strings as MessagePack strings when they are properly UTF-8 encoded otherwise they will become MessagePack binary objects.

There is also a check if a Lua number can be lossless encoded as a 32-bit float.

> **NOTE:** Empty Lua tables will be encoded as empty arrays!

### msgpack.encode(...)
Encodes all given values to a binary MessagePack representation. It will return the binary string or ```nil``` plus an error message if it fails.

```lua
local binary = msgpack.encode('Hello', 1024, true, { 2, 3, 4 })
```

### msgpack.decode_one(binary_data[, position])
Decode the given MessagePack binary string to a corresponding Lua value. It will return the decoded Lua value and the position for next byte in stream
or ```nil``` plus an error message if decoding went wrong. You can use the returned position to decode multiple MessagePack values in a stream.

The optional position argument is used to start the decoding at a specific position inside the the binary_data string.

> **NOTE:** Extended types are not supported. Decoding will fail!

> **NOTE:** Binary data will be decoded as Lua strings

> **NOTE:** Arrays will be decoded as Lua tables starting with index 1 (like Lua uses tables as arrays)

> **NOTE:** Values which are ```nil``` will cause the key, value pair to disappear in a Lua table (that's how it works in Lua)

### msgpack.decode(binary_data[, position])
Decode the given MessagePack binary string to one or more Lua values. It will return all decoded Lua values or ```nil``` plus an error message if decoding failed.

```lua
local a, b, c = msgpack.decode(binary)
```
